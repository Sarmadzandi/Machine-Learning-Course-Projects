# Machine Learning Course Projects

In this course, two projects were conducted. Their full description is available in the relative directory. Besides, a brief description of each one is included in the following:

## Music Track Classifier 

Designed a classification machine in order to classify Iranian music tracks into distinct language classes in which the music has been sung. Different groups of Iranians speak and sing in distinctive languages, five of which were chosen as our classes. Our classifier was supposed to recognize the language in which each track has been sung, by applying machine learning models on the pre-processed music track signals. Gathering proper music tracks, pre-processing music tracks, and preparing a highly informative dataset and training models, all were parts of this project.
