# Machine Learning Course Projects

In this course, we completed two projects. A detailed description of each project is available in the corresponding directory.

## Music Track Classifier 

Designed a classification machine to classify Iranian music tracks into distinct language classes in which the music has been sung. Different groups of Iranians speak and sing in distinctive languages, five of which were chosen as our classes. Our classifier was supposed to recognize the language in which each track has been sung, by applying machine learning models to the pre-processed music track signals. Gathering proper music tracks, pre-processing music tracks, and preparing a highly informative dataset and training models, all were parts of this project.

## Congestive Heart Failure Detection

This project evaluated the effect of machine learning methods in creating the model that classifies normal and congestive heart failure (CHF) in long-term ECG data. We used the autoregressive (AR) Burg method for feature extraction and tested five classifiers, including decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, and a random forest classifier.
